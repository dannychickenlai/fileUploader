Upload multiple files at once with drag and drop. For each file a thumbnail is created automatically. Every upload can be paused, resumed and cancelled individually.
The file uploader currently uses dojo 1.7.1 and PHP 5.3. It works with Firefox 3.6 and Google Chrome 7 or greater.

Resume is only supported on Firefox 4 or greater.
